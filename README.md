Development web from mobile android
This is a web project developed from an Android device, in developing it I used Termux and the Ubuntu root-distro in Termux, I used a backend server programmed with ExpressJS then for the runtime server I used Bunjs which is faster than the NodeJS that I usually use. I'm still trying to display simple HTML, this is quite satisfactory because I only use Android, then I host this website from the Android device that I use, yes, it functions quite like hosting using my local personal computer.
